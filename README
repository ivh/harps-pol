This is an extension to the reduction pipeline for the HARPS 
spectrograph (see http://www.eso.org/sci/facilities/lasilla/instruments/harps/).
It handles the polarization measurements.

The bad code is not really my fault - I had to use existing routines. :-)

The files need to be placed like this:
DRS_HARPS/python/Recipes/obj_pol.py
DRS_HARPS/python/Recipes/obj_sub_pol.py
DRS_HARPS/config/kw_pol.py
